# Comparative Analysis of Religious Texts: NLP Approaches to the Bible Quran and Bhagavad Gita
Religious texts have long shaped cultural, moral, and ethical systems, addressing universal human concerns such as justice, morality, and societal values. Despite their historical significance, the interpretation of these texts has evolved, reflecting shifts in societal priorities over time. Leveraging advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project applies topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and semantic distance measurement to conduct a comparative analysis of religious texts, such as the Bible, Bhagavad Gita, and Quran. The aim is to investigate key modern-day ethical issues such as gender roles, violence, human rights, and freedom of speech within these texts. By analyzing recurring themes and sentiments, the study will explore religious perspectives on topics like religious tolerance, social justice, wealth distribution, and environmental stewardship. The project further employs advanced visualization techniques and corpus comparison tools to quantify thematic similarities and differences, providing a deeper understanding of how sacred texts address critical ethical concerns in todayâ€™s global context. This research underscores the ongoing relevance of religious literature in engaging with contemporary debates on morality, ethics, and human rights.
